            <p class="main-about-text">Veteran Care Network (VCN) is a non-governmental veteran owned and operated service organization formed to provide information to veterans and their families. VCN connects clients to a nationwide list of facilities and organizations that provide various levels of health care, inside and outside of VA medical facilities. This service is extremely beneficial to ensure timely and competent health care for veterans, accomplishing a number of the goals set forth by the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014. In addition to the VCN website, our mobile APP allows veterans to have easy access to health care facilities inside and outside of the VA system. This APP will drastically reduce or eliminate the frustration and wasted time experienced when finding services and treatment for veterans and their families. With the distribution of the new “Choice Cards,” veterans who live at least 40 miles from a VA hospital, or who must travel by air, boat or ferry to access VA care, will be able to find the nearest approved non-government medical care facility. This feature will make healthcare more accessible and treatment more timely, which accomplishes the main goal of the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014.</p>
